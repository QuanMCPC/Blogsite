# Happy April Fools!

Hello! Are you having a good April Fool's Day? I hope so! Because I'm do not. You see, I tried to make an April Fool's joke on my main website, but SO MANY PROBLEM showed up that made me give up.

First, I should probally understand what was the joke first. It was going to be like a page showing that this domain has been seized, and of course, to made it look like a joke, I've added text like: FUCK (Fuck U Criminals, Kay), or "This website was selling sugar and salt illegally". And the page itself was pretty simple too, just a plain black background, white text, with flashing red-blue border.

Ok, now you understand what the joke is, let's see why that one single page caused so many problems.

1. No backup

It was like 3 to 4 weeks before April First, the page was already finished, and it's waiting for it to be published. Now, to make sure I did not lose the page, I've put it into the same folder as the website, but to prevent it getting published, I've added the page to the .gitignore file, and that I do not have any sort of backup (which will become relevant soon).
